# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability on Slotbot, we encourage you to let us know right away.
We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.
Before reporting though, please review our [responsible disclosure policy](#responsible-disclosure-policy), and those things that should not be reported.

Any potential security vulnerabilities should be reported through the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/Alf-Melmac/slotbotServer/security/advisories/new) page.
If you're unsure were to report a vulnerability, please reach out to us at security-advisory@webalf.de.

### Responsible Disclosure Policy

We ask that:

- You give us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and mitigate an issue you report before you publish or share information about the report with others.
- You do not interact with an individual account (including modifying or accessing data from the account) unless the account owner has consented to such actions.
- You make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions to others, including (but not limited to) destruction of data and interruption or degradation of our services.
- You do not exploit a vulnerability you discover for any reason. (This includes demonstrating additional risk, such as attempting to compromise sensitive company data or probing for additional issues).
- You do not violate any other applicable laws or regulations.

While we greatly appreciate community reports of security issues, we do not currently offer compensation for vulnerability reports.
